# SmartForm
A simple interactive and conditional form with jQuery


### Task Breakdown

  - 9 Views with 6 Questions
  - Show a question per view with Next/Previous buttons
  - Do conditional display of next/previous questions based on user’s selection
  - Implement Form Validation: Email format, required fields (only allow Next when data valid)  
  - Store user’s answers in a JavaScript Object
  - After completion of form, display all the answers in a new view
  - Persistence with Web Storage: Browser should remember user’s place in survey and retain data if user leaves and comes back to page
  - Bonus: use jQuery animations for transition effects between views
